    This function implements two methods to solve Lambert's Problem, a fast 
    method developed by Dr Izzo of ESA and a robust method based on work by
    Lancaster and Blanchard [2], and Gooding [3]. This code is written 
    following a MATLAB version written by Rody Oldenhuis, copyright below.
    
    Parameters
    ------
    r0_vect : 3x1 numpy array
        position vector at t0 [km]

    tof : float
        time of flight [sec]
    m : int
        number of complete orbit revolutions
    GM : float
        graviational parameter of central body [km^3/s^2]
        
    Returns
    ------
    v0_vect : 3x1 numpy array
        velocity vector at t0 [km/s]
    vf_vect : 3x1 numpy array
        velocity vector at tf [km/s]
    extremal_distances : list
        min and max distance from central body during orbit [km]
